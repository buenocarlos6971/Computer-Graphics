Avoke is our website that we built for our semester project. It was created to give people a way to visualize the music they listen to. Our Avoke website will first have you create an account needing an email and a password. The user after signing up will be given the option to sign in. The user will then be directed to our home page and be able to visualize. Once and audio file is uploaded the visulaizer will play an animation. The user will additionally have access to the Avoke about us and to login again.

Our project is deployed on heroku, and completed by EJS and Node.JS code. Our project has a Postgresql database for uses to store their peronal information like name and password. The code languages are: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SCSS.

We seperated the whole semester to sprints to finish the whole project. In sprint 1, we designed a prototype with html and css, and decided what name will be used for our project, Also designed the logo for the whole webb. In sprint2, we did architecture diagram and decide what tools and methods will be used to finish the project, added features like change password and user name, and confirmed the style and layout of our front end. Most important, we wrote our first server.js, and try to deploy the web on our own host. In sprint 3 and 4, we designed the database diagram and user testcase. We also created a database with Postgresql and renew the server.js in sprint 3. All of members focused on style change, frontend and backend and bug fixed during that sprint. 

Before the last sprint, the repo structure was like ../sprint1, ../sprint2... At last sprint, we changed the struture to navigate easily and put all the code we need together. Right now, the deprecated file stores all old sprints files. Project_milestones stores all our milestone files and reports. Resources, scripts and views are cores of our project, these files contain nodejs code, embeded javascript(ejs)and scripts for web, all of the images, style sheet and database design.

Our website testing was focused on user acceptence crtieria and if the visualizer worked the way it should.
