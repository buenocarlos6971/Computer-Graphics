Code Reuse:
Used Code from Hw6  to make an overall outline for my code and get textures working
Also reused code from Hw6 for makefile and other files needed.
Reused code fom Hw3, Hw4,Hw5, and Hw6 as well.

How to run:
Run the make file and then the exe

Instructions:
esc: exit program

down arrow: rotate view down
left arrow: rotate view to left
right arrow: rotate view to right
page up: increase dim
page down: decrease dim
y key: will turn off the walls if you want to view from another angle

0: resets viewing angle
p: prespective/orthogonal switch

What remains: 
I need to get my first person mode working correctly as when I tried to implement it the mode was not working how I wanted it.
I also need to find some different textures to make the room look better for example I want to make or find a texture with pictures to make the walls look less bare.
I also may create objects to put on the table such as food to accompy the pepsi's.
I would also like to add a feature where the user can flip through multiple channels on the tv to add an interactive element. 
If time allows I may want to allow change the textures of everything in the room to see what the room would look like with different color pallets.
